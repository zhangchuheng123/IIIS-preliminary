Each path in the graph starting from a distinguished vertex $v_0 \\in V$ corresponds to a possible sequence of sounds produced by the model. We define the label of a directed path to be the concatenation of the labels of the edges on that path.\n",

The sum of the probabilities of the edges leaving any vertex equals 1. The probability of a path is defined to be the product of the probabilities of its edges. We can view the probability of a path beginning at $v_0$ as the probability that a random walk beginning at $v_0$ will follow the specified path, where we randomly choose which edge to take leaving a vertex $u$ according to the probabilities of the available edges leaving $u$. Extend your answer to part 1 so that if a path is returned, it is a most probable path starting at $v_0$ and having label $s$. Analyze the running time of your algorithm."

    "In this problem, we explore an interesting trick to speed up a dynamic program. We use the edit distance problem as an example (See the last problem). We assume the size of the alphabet is constant. Suppose the two strings are $S_1$ and $S_2$, both of length $n$. To start with, your solution for the last problem must run in $O(n^2)$ time. If it is so, in the dynamic program for the problem, you need to fill a two dimensional table $M$. In fact, we can fill out this table in a more clever way such that the running time can be improved to $O(n^2/ \\log n)$ (I know, it is a small improvement and of little practical interests for this particular problem. But the same trick has been used somewhere else to make a huge difference). In this trick, we need to a bit preprocessing to make many small tables. Then we fill only a subset of entries of the dynamic program table. The value of a table entry we are filling depends on the values of some entries we have already filled and the list we made in the beginning.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 一般证明步骤：\n",
    "    1. 证明是NP（给定一个候选的解，能够在多项式时间内检验解是不是合理的解）\n",
    "    2. 能够把一个现成的NPC问题规约到这个问题上（给定一个NPC问题，把NPC问题的输入在多项式时间内变为这个问题的输入，再将这个问题的输出变化为该NPC问题的输出）\n",
    "* 常见NPC问题：\n",
    "    1. 3SAT：给定一堆布尔变量和一堆子句（形如A或者B或者C），是否存在一个布尔变量的赋值是的所有子句为真。\n",
    "    2. Independent Set：图G中的顶点集合S满足其中的任意两个顶点不共边，则称S为独立集；求解图G的最大独立集。\n",
    "    3. Vertex Cover：图的顶点覆盖是一组顶点的集合，使得图的每个边缘至少与集合中的一个顶点相连接；求解图G的最大顶点覆盖。\n",
    "    4. Integer Linear Programming：线性方程组是否存在整数解\n",
    "    5. Hamiltonian Cycle：一个图是否存在Hamiltonian cycle\n",
    "    6. Subset Sum：给定一组整数，是否存在一些整数使得其和等于K\n",
    "    7. Bin Packing：给定一组一维长度小于1的线段，找出这堆线段的一个划分，使得划分的子集数目最小，并且每个子集中线段的和都小于1\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 给定一个矩形的分配方案，我们能够在多项式内验证这个方案是否可以，即，逐对检查矩形是否相交，并且是否超出了大矩形，即是NP\n",
    "2. 我们从Bin Packing规约，给定Bin Packing的一个输入$x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n$，构造一个Tiling的输入，使得n个矩形的宽度分别为$x_i$，长度为2（任何大于1的数都可以），大举行的宽度为1，长度为$2k$。我们依次增加k，看看最少k等于多少时，能够把这些矩形都包含进去，返回这个k。这个k的数值就是Bin Packing问题里面最少需要的子集个数。注意到因为小矩形的长大于1，因此没法旋转，只能横向排。\n"
